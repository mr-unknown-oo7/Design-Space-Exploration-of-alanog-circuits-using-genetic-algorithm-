Design Space Exploration of alanog circuits using genetic algorithm 
Finding optimal component values in analog circuits is often challenging. Traditional design can produce impractical values (e.g., non-standard resistor or capacitor sizes), forcing designers to rely on approximations and settle for suboptimal results.
To overcome this, I combined a Genetic Algorithm with PyLTSpice to automate design space exploration in LTSpice. As a test case, I optimized a boost converter (5V → 90V for a 1kΩ load). The search space consisted of ~11.5 million possible parameter combinations, yet the GA converged on an optimal solution in just 41 minutes. The resulting circuit achieved:
Median output: 89.44V (only 0.56V off target) with a variance of 0.53V in the steady state.
This project highlights how evolutionary algorithms, when paired with simulation automation tools like PyLTSpice, can significantly accelerate analog design optimization.
I’m looking forward to connecting with like-minded people exploring Design Space Exploration, circuit automation, and evolutionary computation.Finding optimal component values in analog circuits is often challenging.
